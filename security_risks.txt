Attacker can scan the network for these open ports to identify some vulnerability that is associated with that
service/protocol that is running on that port and try to get onto the network or install some malware through it.
It could also be used for DOS attacks.
Leaving ports ope means increasing attack surface so it gives the attacker more ways to get through to the network or
device/server.
There could be MITM attacks as unencrypted traffic flows through them and all the attacker has to do is sort through
the packets to steal critical information.

for an open port 53, there could be DNS spoofing(changing ip address to a domain) and other attacks.

for an open port 80, there could be MITM attack and theinfo could easily be read as transferred in plaintext,
so passwords, credit card info could easily be leaked.
