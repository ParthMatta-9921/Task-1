This was for the 1st Task.

I found my netwrok range and ran a nmap on it and found the open ports listedi open_ports.txt.

Listed the ip adresses that were being used as well.

Analysed the open ports and thought of the security risks that they pose.

Ran the optional wireshark capture and found the packets being used in a goole search-173 to 380 packet no.s.
